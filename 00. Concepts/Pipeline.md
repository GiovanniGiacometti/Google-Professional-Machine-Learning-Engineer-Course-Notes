Many services are based on the concept of pipeline. It would be nice to clarify what each pipeline actually is and how they relate to each other.

**Kubeflow** pipelines

**TFX** pipelines. These can be orchestrated in 3 ways:
- beam (i think some tfx components are translated into beam components)
- kubeflow (does this mean that the pipeline developed in tfx becomes a kubeflow pipeline or it's just that kubeflow supports the orchestration?)
- airflow (composer)
