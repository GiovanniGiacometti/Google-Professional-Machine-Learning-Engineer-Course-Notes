Beam is an abstraction worth learning -> "write code once and never worry about scaling data processing again"


- Unified: programming model for batch and stream
- Portable: provide a choice of execution envs
- Extensible


How does it relate to TFX?

Apache Beam scales TFX component libraries
Beam scales the computation of many underlying TF libraries for whole dataset statistics.

Beam also powers inference

Beam abstracts complexity to distribute pipeline data processing

Beam primitives:

- pipeline -> set of operations
- pcollection -> set of data
- ptransform -> data processing operation that operates over 1 to many pcollections
- runner: execute and translate pipelines to massively parallel big data processing systems

Each beam supported component is transformed in a beam graph
