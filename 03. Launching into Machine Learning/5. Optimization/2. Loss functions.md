We need a measure to compare points in the parameter space

- MSE: the problem is that it might be difficult to interpret as it is expressed in squared terms ->
- RMSE

It doesn't work for classifications problems as it doesn't penalize bad classification appropriately

When the target is 0 and the prediction is 1, the loss is 3 times higher than when the prediction is 0.5 (due to how the root works i guess, but nonetheless we don't care about the distance to 0, it's not a matter of predicting a continuous value here)


- Log Loss (cross entropy)

Formula of cross entropy:
the first half counts when the label is positive, the second instead when the label is negative
