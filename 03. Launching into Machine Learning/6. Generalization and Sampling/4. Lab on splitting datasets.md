He adds 3 fields:

- the date_hash, computed with farm_fingerprint
- the "remainder_divide_by_70", with the result of the mod operation applied between farm_fingerprint and 70
- the "remainder_divide_by_700"

That's because we want to see if the remainder is 0 on the 70 column and use those samples to pick 1% of the dataset (which is composed of 70_000_000 samples) and then split that one percent with the other column by dividing between those having the modulo greater and lower than 350


The problem with the dataset is that the same days will end up together (the has is the same)
