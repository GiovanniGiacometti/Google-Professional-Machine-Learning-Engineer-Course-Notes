Use RAND() < ... to split data - this approach is not reproducible / repeatable.

Another way to do it is using hashing function (farm_fingerprint) on the column we use to split and then use the modulo operator to only get a portion of data.

Since the hash function is unique, it is repeatable

Split has to happen on a field you can afford to lose

A good idea is to develop a ML model on a small sample, as it's expensive
