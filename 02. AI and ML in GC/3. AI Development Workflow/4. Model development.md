Recall: TP / TP + FN -> focus on real positive cases

Focusing on positive cases means that we are interested in getting as many positives as we can (think of a medical context in which we are performing cancer detection). The highest the number of real positives that we can identify as such, the higher the recall will be

Precision: TP / TP + FP -> focuses on predicted positives

Focusing on predicted positives means that we are interested in being precise and identifying correctly as many samples as possible. The higher the threshold, the higher the precision
