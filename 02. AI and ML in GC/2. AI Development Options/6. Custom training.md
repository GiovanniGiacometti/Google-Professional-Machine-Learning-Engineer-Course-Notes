2 options for environment:

- Pre-built container (python, tf, pt)
- Custom container (details must be specified)

Vertex AI Workbench can be used
It's like a jupyiter notebook deployed in a single development environment, that can support the whole development process (from exploring to deploying)

Another option is Colab enterprise (integrated in Vertex AI)

Tensorflow

multiple abstraction layers

- Hardware
- Core TF
- TF model libreries (layers, losses)
- Keras

Vertex AI hosts all layers
