Unified platforms that supports various technologies and tools to build ML projects from end to end
 
Challenges in building AI models:
- Handling large quantities of data
- Determining the right ML model
- Computing power

Once it's deployed, challenges are:
- scalability
- monitoring
- ci

Google solutions to these problems is Vertex AI

- End to end ML pipeline to prepare data, create and deploy a model

Data readiness: data can be uploaded from wherever they are stored (Cloud storage, BigQuery..)

Feature readiness: users can create feature and share them with others using feature store

Training and Hyperparameter tuning

Deployment and model monitoring

- Both predictive AI and Generative AI

Predictive AI -> AutoML and custom training
Generative AI -> later

---

- Seamless (smooth user experience)
- Scalable
- Sustainable
- Speedy
