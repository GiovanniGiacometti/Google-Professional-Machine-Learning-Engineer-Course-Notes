Set of practices that expand MLOps for operationalizing generative AI applications

---

Workflow:

Experiment becomes more a discovery of pretrained models (easy testing)

We focus on finetuning pretrained models

Curated data are crucial

New artifacts (finetuning, embedding layers..)

New metrics in the evaluation 

Moreover, integration of new data (RAG) increase the complexity
