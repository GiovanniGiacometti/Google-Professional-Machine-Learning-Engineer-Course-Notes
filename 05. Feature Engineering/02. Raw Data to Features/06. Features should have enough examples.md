Rule of thumb: at least 5 examples of any values

---

What about continuous values?
Group and find if there are enough samples in each bucket. If not, bucket again.

The distribution should be considered to take outliers into consideration -> plot histograms

Let's say we have 1 example where the distance is greater than 500 miles. If we use that feature, then whenever a new data point will have an high value in that feature, the prediction is going to be the one of the training sample.

A good idea is to bucketize
