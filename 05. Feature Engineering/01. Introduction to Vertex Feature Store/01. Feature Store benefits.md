Challenges:

- hard to share and reuse
- hard to reliable serve in production with low latency
- inadvertent skew in feature values between train and serving

---

Feature stores solve all this problems

Vertex AI Feature Store offers this service.

It's a fully managed solution

-> share and reuse ML features across use cases
-> serve at scale, as everything is handled
-> compute feature values once and re use them for training and serving
-> both streaming and batch ingestions are supported
