Challenges:

- Data quality
- Subjectivity and methodological complexity, due to the vast domain of the answers
- Biases in evaluation (investigate the effect of mitigation tools)
- Generalization and real world applicability 
- Security concerns (manipulated model predictions / poisoned training data)

Data related challenges:

- lack of data
- contamination (testing data leak into testing data)

Dataset quality:
- Dataset criteria (basically no answer yet)
