Many issues and challenges:

- Data Issues: overfitting
- Data shift: can lead to a decline in model performance
- Lack of representative data
- Metric choice - should be aligned with project goals
- Interpretability - concern when high stakes decisions are involved
- Bias and fairness - bias can be amplified by the model
- Deployment and monitoring issues

Moreover, technical and logistic challenges

Mitigate:

- Comprehensive evaluation: use many metrics
- Data validation and splitting ensures the assessment is reliable
- Overfitting: regularization + dropout + early stopping
- Model monitoring: tracks performance and identify drifts
- Explainability tools (lime, shap)

VertexAI provides all these essential functionalities

---

What is needed:

- trained model (both custom or automl)
- batch prediction output
- ground truth dataset

VertexAI provides many metrics to assess the performance
(multiple metrics can be computed with multiple models to see which performs better)

Iterate and improve to optimize performance

Models:
- classification
- reg
- forecasting

for many modalities of data (images, text, tabular)
