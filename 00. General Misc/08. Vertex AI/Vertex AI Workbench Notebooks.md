Vertex AI offers two Notebook Solutions, Workbench and [[Colab Enterprise]].

### Workbench

Vertex AI Workbench is a good option for projects that prioritize control and customizability. It’s great for complex projects spanning multiple files, with complex dependencies. It’s also a good choice for a data scientist who is transitioning to the cloud from a workstation or laptop.

Vertex AI Workbench Instances comes with a preinstalled suite of deep learning packages, including support for the TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.
