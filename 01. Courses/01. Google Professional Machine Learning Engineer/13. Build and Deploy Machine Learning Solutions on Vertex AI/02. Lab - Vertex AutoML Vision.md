Vertex AI brings together the Google Cloud services for building ML under one, unified UI and API. In Vertex AI, you can now easily train and compare models using [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/beginner/beginners-guide/) or custom code training and all your models are stored in one central model repository. These models can now be deployed to the same endpoints on Vertex AI.

AutoML Vision helps anyone with limited Machine Learning (ML) expertise train high quality image classification models. In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to produce a custom ML model that automatically recognizes damaged car parts. Since the time it takes to train the model is above the time limit of the lab, you will interact and request predictions from a hosted model in a different project trained on the same dataset. You will then tweak the values of the data for the prediction request and examine how it changes the resulting prediction from the model.


- create a bucket and upload data 
- create a managed dataset in vertex ai and connect the dataset to the cloud storage bucket
