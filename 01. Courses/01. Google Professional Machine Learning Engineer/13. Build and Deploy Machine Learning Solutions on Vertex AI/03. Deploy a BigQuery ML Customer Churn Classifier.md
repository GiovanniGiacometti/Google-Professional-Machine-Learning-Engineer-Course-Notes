In this lab, you will train, tune, evaluate, explain, and generate batch and online predictions with a BigQuery ML XGBoost model. You will use a Google Analytics 4 dataset from a real mobile application, Flood it! ([Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.labpixies.flood), [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flood-it%21/id476943146?mt=8)), to determine the likelihood of users returning to the application.

[BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/introduction) lets you train and do batch inference with machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries faster by eliminating the need to move data with fewer lines of code. [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) is Google Cloud's complimentary next generation, unified platform for machine learning development. By developing and deploying BQML machine learning solutions on Vertex AI, you can leverage a scalable online prediction service and MLOps tools for model retraining and monitoring to significantly enhance your development productivity, the ability to scale your workflow and decision making with your data, and accelerate time to value.
