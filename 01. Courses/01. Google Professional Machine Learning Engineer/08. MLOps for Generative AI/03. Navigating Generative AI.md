Challenges of GenAI:

----

- Increased AI infrastructure needs

Robust infra to support training, experimenting and deployment.

A solution is to leverage Vertex AI infrastructure and scalability

How:

- Model Garden: provides access to a large plethora of models
- Vertex AI generative studio: test prompts and finetune models.
- Vertex AI Training - Prediction: vertex takes care of everything.

---

- Customizing and tuning models

Customize models to our needs

Vertex AI offers:
- Supervised tuning
- RL with human feedback () both for google and open source models
- Data curation: augmenting training data with domain specific data

----

- Managing new artifacts (additional layers, embeddings)

Vertex AI:

- Vertex AI Feature Store to store and serve embeddings
- Vertex Model Registry to manage layers obtained after fine tuning
- Vertex AI Pipelines streamlines finetuning jobs

---

Evaluation and monitoring

- New evaluation metrics available in VertexAI
- Safety scores
- Recitation check (scan model output to ensure no matches with existing content are present)

----

Connect to enterprise data

- Embeddings and Vector Search: can be used to integrated enterprise data. 
- Grounding (reduce hallucinations)
- Vertex Extensions (to connect with data sources)
