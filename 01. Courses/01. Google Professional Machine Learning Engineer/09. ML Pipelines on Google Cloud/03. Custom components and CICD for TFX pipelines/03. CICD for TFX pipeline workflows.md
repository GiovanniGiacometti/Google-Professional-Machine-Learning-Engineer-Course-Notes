Continuous Integration: development process of working from a shared code repository or pipeline code, unit testing, integration testing and continuous delivery of your TFX pipeline to production.

Continuous Deployment: automatic the building, testing and releasing of TFX pipeline code

Continuous Training: process monitoring, measuring, retraining and serving ML models produced by the pipeline.

Cloud build is a managed service that executes the container builds on Google Cloud infrastructure.

Cloud Build executes your builds as a series of build steps defined in a build Yaml configuration file.

Each build step is run as a container (both custom or those provided)

The Cloud Build process, which performs the required CI/CD for your model system, can be executed either manually or through automated build triggers with Cloud Functions or GitHub actions.

Triggers execute your configured build steps whenever the changes are pushed to the build source code (for instance, when certain changes to the repo)

In addition, you have build routines, Cloud Build configuration files, that are executed in response to different triggers.

For example, you can set build routines to start when condensed or merged to your TFX project main branch from individual pipeline developer branches to promote collaboration.

Level 0 automation: notebooks pipeline prototyping

context.export_to_pipeline that goes from the notebook to a production execution

---

Level 1: TFX pipeline continuous training through manual or automatic triggers.

For instance, retrain the model with new hyperparameters (don't need to run the ingestion and processing parts)

To add additional automation, you can leverage Google Cloud services such as Cloud Functions to develop automatic triggers for full pipeline runs based off of new data, for example.

Level 2: TFX CI/CD pipelines

Q/A env: staging environment where code is deployed first which can run the TFX pipeline end to end through any integration tests between components

Future state: more managed services

- Feature stores: scalable access to features that can be reused across use cases, decoupling feature engineering and usage.
