It has a configuration file and a serialized model artifact

Dependencies for reproducibility

MLflow provides utilities to create and load models and also to deploy them

---

log_model() produces a directory (similar to a project)

MLmodel config file, serialized model and a collection of variables.

Config model contains the run_id and a field called flavor, which is a language and tool specific representation of an MLflow model. In this way we know what tools to use to load the model
