Run containers as airflow tasks

-> KubernetesPodOperator 

(not generally recommended)

-> GKEPodOperator (launch a pod in a specified GKE cluster)

Should be idempotent ->

the pod will have to run to completion, despite any Airflow worker shutdown or restart.
It is possible that the task will be run twice for this reason, and you will want to ensure that this will not cause any problems in your workflow.

TFX includes an AirflowDagRunner as the runner
