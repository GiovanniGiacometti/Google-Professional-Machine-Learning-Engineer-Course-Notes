Reusable pre configured components

---

**ExampleGen**

https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/examplegen

ingest data from files and outputs training and eval datasets
Customizable to new input formats and ingestion methods.
Apache Beam also supported

Supports MLOps data management capabilities

Concept of span: grouping of training examples. How the group is formed is customizable.

Span can be splitted into splits (like train, test, dev)

---

**StatisticGen**

Produces a datasets of statistics.

It uses the tensorflow data validation to calculate feature statistics
Scalable using Apache Beam

---

**SchemaGen** (optional, usually used during prototyping)

Infer characteristics of the data using data split and statistics.

Produces a schema artifact

---

**Example Validator**

Reads from statistics and schema and outputs an anomalies report 

- Validity checks
- Detect train-serving skew
- Data drift

---

**Transform**

Data, Schema, Code -> Transformed graph (encapsulating feature eng logic) and data

Basically performs feature engineering
