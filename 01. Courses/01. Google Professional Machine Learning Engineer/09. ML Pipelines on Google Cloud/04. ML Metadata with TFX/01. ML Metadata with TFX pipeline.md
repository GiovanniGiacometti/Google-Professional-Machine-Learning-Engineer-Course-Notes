TFX's Metadata Store

- Trained Models -> artifacts type definitions and their properties (the actual models are either in cloud storage or elsewhere)
- Execution records of components
- Data provenance across all executions

Linked records between all artifacts

Keep track of which models have been selected for deployment.
