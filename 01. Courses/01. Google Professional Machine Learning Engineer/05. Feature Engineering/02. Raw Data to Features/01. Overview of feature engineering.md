Combine domain knowledge, intuition and data science skills to create the features that make the model perform better.

---

The process is complex:

- Brainstorm features
	- Delve into the problem, to understand how to get the most
	- Look at a lot of data
	- Leverage domain specific features 
	- Study other feature engineering problems
- Devise features
	- Manual feature extraction
	- Automatic feature extraction (dimensionality reduction, such as PCA)
	- Manual and automatic

Feature columns:
- numerical, categorical
- embedding
- hashed
- cross features

---

Iterative process: process continues until RMSE is lowest

---

Types:

- Use indicator variables to isolate key information (isolate specific areas of the training dataset)
- Highlight interaction between 2 or more features (sum, product..)
- Represent the same feature in a different way (like one hot encoding)
