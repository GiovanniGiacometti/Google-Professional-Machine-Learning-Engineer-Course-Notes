Representation transformation: 
- convert a numerical feature to a categorical column (bucketization)
- convert categorical features to a numeric representation (on hot, feature embeddings..)

Feature construction:

- Create new feature (poly expansion, feature crossing)

Big Query supports 2 types of FE:

- Automatic: during training
- Manual: it provides the transform clause to define custom preprocessing using the manual preprocessing functions

Basic FE:

For non numeric columns other than timestamp, BigQueryML performs a one hot encoding transformation
