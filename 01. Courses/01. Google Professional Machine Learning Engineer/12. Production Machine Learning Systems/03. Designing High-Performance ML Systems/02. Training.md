What does High Performance mean in ML?

Many aspects, but surely Model training time matters.

(assuming the same performance metrics is reached)

Another aspect is budget -> 3 considerations

- time (usually a business decision)
- cost (still a business decision)
- scale (model differ in terms of computational complexity. Another choice is related to the size of the dataset) - choosing optimized infrastructure is also important

Another option is to start from checkpoints

Model training performance is bound to some constraints:

- input/output

if large inputs, it requires parsing or if the model is low (thus having low computation requirements) 

- cpu

if expensive computations, underpowered hardware

- memory

large number of inputs, complex model with a lot of free parameters


Knowing what's the bound we can take action 

-> IO bound:
- store efficiently
- parallel reads
- remodulate batch size

-> CPU bound
- faster accelerator
- upgrade processor
- TPUs
- simplify model

-> Memory bound
- reduce batch size
- fewer layers
- add memory to the worker
