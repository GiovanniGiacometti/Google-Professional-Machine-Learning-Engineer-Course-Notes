Data drift causes:

- change in behaviour
- selection bias
- non stationary environments

Concept drifts:
- ecommerce apps
- sensors
- movie recommendations

What to do then?

Data drift -> enough of the data needs to be relabeled to introduce new classes and the model retrained

Concept drift -> old data needs to be relabeled and the model retrained

---

System can be designed to detect changes

Or use an ensemble approach
