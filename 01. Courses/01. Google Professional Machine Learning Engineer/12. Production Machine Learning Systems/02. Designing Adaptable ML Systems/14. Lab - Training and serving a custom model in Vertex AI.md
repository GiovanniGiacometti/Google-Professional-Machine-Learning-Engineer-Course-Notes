You are going to submit this training job to Vertex by putting your training code in a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and pushing this container to [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry). Using this approach, you can train a model built with any framework.

```docker
FROM gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/tf2-cpu.2-3
WORKDIR /root

WORKDIR /

# Copies the trainer code to the docker image.
COPY trainer /trainer

# Sets up the entry point to invoke the trainer.
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "-m", "trainer.train"]
```
