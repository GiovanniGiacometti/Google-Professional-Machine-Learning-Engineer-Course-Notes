ML assumptions

-> instances are generated at random according to some probability distribution D
-> instances are independent and identically distributed
-> D is stationary with fixed distribution

---

Drift -> change between training data and real time data

Data drift -> P(X)
Concept drift -> P(X|y)
Prediction drift -> P(ypred|X)

For example, a larger proportion of credit-worthy applications when your product was launched in a more affluent area. Your model still holds, but your business may beÂ  unprepared for this scenario.

Label drift -> P(y)

---

Concept drift

Stationary supervised learning -> historical data can be used to make predictions

Learning under concept drift -> statistical properties of the class variable change over time

---

Streaming data -> a fault in sensors might cause a change in the input distribution

---

Concept drift can occur both for shifts in feature space and decision boundary

---

- sudden drift
- gradual drift
- incremental drift
- recurring concepts
