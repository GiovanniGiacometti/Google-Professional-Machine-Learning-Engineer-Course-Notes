- Changes in label distribution

For instance, in the dataset where the target variable is the baby weight -> the weight has changed over the years

It might mean that the relationship with features has changed, not necessarily

- Changes in feature distribution

Extrapolation -> generalize outside the bounds of what we have previously seen

Interpolation is the opposite (of course, it's much easier)

How to protect ourselves?

- Monitoring
- Check residuals to see if they have changed
- Emphasize data recency (retraining model on recent data or writing a custom loss function)
