Training -> train various ML models to help identify patterns

Evaluation -> estimate generalization accuracy of the model

We need to know if we can trust its predictions

Evaluation is with respect to some business related metrics

After development, it is tested


Model validation -> look at performance by slides and see if the accuracy is the one desired (it's more related to comparing the performance with some threshold)
