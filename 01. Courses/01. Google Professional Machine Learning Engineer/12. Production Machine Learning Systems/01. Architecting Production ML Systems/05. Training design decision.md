Static training vs Dynamic training

It's the same but when dynamic the training process is repeated when new data arrive

Static
- simpler to build and test
- likely to become stale

It depends on the relationship that we are trying to model.

Engineering is also harder for dynamic

Might also just start with static as it's simpler

Static training-> just push to cloud (ai platform)

Dynamic training -> cloud functions, app engine, dataflow
