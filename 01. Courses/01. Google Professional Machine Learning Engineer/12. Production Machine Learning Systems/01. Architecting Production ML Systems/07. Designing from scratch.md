Build a system that predicts the traffic levels on roads

Training style -> probably dynamic

Serving architecture -> 

Prediction distribution should be peaked, the requests are more likely to come from important roads

The cardinality of the set? Need more info, it depends on:

- historical traffic data (we don't know how much big a region is). We don't know if we want to generalize in data or time
- problem framing (we don't know if predictions are to be made hourly, every minute..)
