Vertex-AI brings together into a unified interface all steps of the ML workflow

---

Unified data preparation tool

Data are stored in a Cloud Storage bucket

---

Notebooks is a tool for create and experiment with models

Can configure the machines

---

Training 

Custom code training or AutoML

- Training pipelines is the primary training tool

It orchestrates the training

- Custom Jobs specify how Vertex AI runs custom training code, including pools, machine types and settings (not for AutoML)

- Hyperparameter tuning jobs (not for AutoML)

---

Models

A new model can be trained, or an existing imported

They can be then deployed to an endpoint

---

Endpoints

Serve online / batch predictions

You might deploy a single model to multiple endpoints to test out a new model before serving it to all traffic.
