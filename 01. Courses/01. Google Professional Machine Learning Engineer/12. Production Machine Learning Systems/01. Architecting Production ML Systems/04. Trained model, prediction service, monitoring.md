Trained model is pushed to the model registry

The model registry captures all governance data required for auditing purpose (who trained the model, which datasets were used..)


Prediction service -> answer questions

Retrieve a model (for instance in pickle) and expose REST API call


Performance monitoring -> let's detect model performance degradation.
The output is fed into the data analysis module

Other metrics can be monitored, such as latency, traffic and similar
