Why hybrid?

Sometimes you can't be solely on the cloud

-> tied to on-premise infrastructure
-> data is produced on different clouds 
-> running ML on the edge - connectivity constraints force to do inference on the edge

Kubernetes minimizes infrastructure management

Specifically kubeflow helps migrate from cloud to on premise environments

Kubeflow can be run everywhere, with the same code, both on a phone or on Google Cloud
