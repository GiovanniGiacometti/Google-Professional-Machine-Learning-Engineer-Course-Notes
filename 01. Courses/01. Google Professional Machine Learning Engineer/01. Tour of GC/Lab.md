Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) is a service to inspect and modify roles and permissions that define who has access to what resources

3 basic roles offered by GC. They set project level permissions:
- Viewer: read only actions, don't affect state
- Editor: can modify state
- Owner: can manage roles and permissions for a project and all its resources. Can set up billing
