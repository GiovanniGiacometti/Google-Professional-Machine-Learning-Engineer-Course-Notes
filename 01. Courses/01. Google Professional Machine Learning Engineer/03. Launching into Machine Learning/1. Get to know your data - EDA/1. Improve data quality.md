An AI/ML pipeline
1. Data

- Extraction
- Analysis
- Preparation -> data transformation (cleansing, alter data types, convert categorical data) / feature engineering

Data quality attributes:
- Complete -> is any of the data missing?
- Accurate -> are the data correct in terms of what they describe
- Timely -> time between when info is expected and when it is available for use
- Consistent -> is the dataset consistent in different representation of the same dataset?

How to improve?
- Resolve missing values
- Bring date feature to datetime format (or transform it into multiple columns for year, month etc)
- Convert categorical
- Remove unwanted data

Process of cleaning data is not sequential, can be iterative

2. Model

- Training
- Evaluation
- Validation


3. MLops

- Trained model -> model registry <-> serving
