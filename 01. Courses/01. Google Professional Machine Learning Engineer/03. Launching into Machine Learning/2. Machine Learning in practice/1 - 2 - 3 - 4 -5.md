Regression: predict continuous label values

The lab is this one:

No linear regression for classification -> the output might be out of the ranges (supposing 0 and 1 as labels)

Sigmoid is a calibrated probability estimate
We can cast binary classification problems to probabilistic problems

Saturation: vanishing gradient when gradients are closed to the extremes -> we can use regularization to help logits stay away from asymptotes

We can also use early stopping

At the end of the day, we need to make a binary decision -> choose threshold
ROC can be used to choose threshold
AUC can instead help decide between modesl
