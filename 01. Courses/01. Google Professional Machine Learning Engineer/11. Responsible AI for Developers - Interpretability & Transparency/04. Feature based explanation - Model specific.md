- Integrated Gradients

Designed for Neural Networks

Gradient of the output with respect to each input features

As your model learns the relationship between the range of an individual pixel and the correct class, the gradient becomes increasingly small -> saturation

Integrated gradients overcome saturation ->

 
set a baseline image (all zeros)

construct a sequence of images interpolating from black to the actual image (step = alpha)

Average gradients across these images

Drawbacks -> if black pixels are important, they don't receive any attribution -> baseline image should be correctly chosen


XRAI improves upon IG

XRAI overcomes the baselines selection problem by using both a black and white baselines images
