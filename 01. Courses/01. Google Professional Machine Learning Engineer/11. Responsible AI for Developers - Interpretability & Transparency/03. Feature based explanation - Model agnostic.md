Image classification -> highlights the pixels that most contributed to the model prediction

Tabular data -> how much each feature contributed

Text classification -> how much each token contributed to the score

Global techniques and Local techniques

---

Global:

- Permutation Feature Importance

Shuffle feature and see how the model performance is affected

Intuitive, easy, might also be misleading 

- Partial Dependence Plots 

Post-hoc, global, model agnostic

Visualize relationship between a model's prediction and the values of specific input features (keeping all equals and changing one)

Produces plots, usually the feature that changes against the model prediction

---

Local

- Lime 
post-hoc, local, model agnostic

Creates an explanation by approximating the underlying model locally, with an interpretable one (linear model / decision tree)

Perturbation procedure depends on the data type

- Shapley values
post-hoc, local, model agnostic

Sum up to 1

Too complex when features are many -> approximated algorithms

Sampled Shapley, Kernel Shap, Tree Shap
