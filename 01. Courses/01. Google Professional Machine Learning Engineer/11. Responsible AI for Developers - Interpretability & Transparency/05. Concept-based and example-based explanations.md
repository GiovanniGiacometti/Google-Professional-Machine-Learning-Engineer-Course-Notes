Concept-based

Create attributions score for user-friendly concepts

TCAV -> testing with concept activation vectors
post-hoc, global, model-specific

Gather a user-defined set of examples that exemplify the concept of interest, such as strike patterns, along with a set of random examples

Collect, label training data instances representing the target class

Train target neural network to process the prepared concept data

In a feature space of an intermediate layer of the model, train a linear classifier to distinguish between the representations produced by the concepts examples and those from random examples.

The concept activation vector is the vector perpendicular to the classification boundary and represented by the red arrow.

Becoming a dataset for concept might be complex

ACE: automatic concept based explanations

Split the target image into smaller crop segments, then rescale back to the original image resolution to ensure compatibility with the target neural network.

Apply K-means clustering inside the feature space of an intermediate layer of the target neural network.

Each cluster is regarded as an automatically created concept.

Calculate concept activation vectors for each cluster to determine the attribution of each concept to the prediction (same as TCAV)
