Google is an AI first company.

3 layers in which the toolbox is organized:

- **AI foundation layer**: cloud essentials like compute, storage, network, data tools (like big query).
- **AI development layer**: explore different options to build an ML project, including out of the box solutions (low code or no code). This includes Vertex AI, the AI development platform provided by Google Cloud
- **Generative AI**


(not sure if this division is just how the course is organized (more likely) or if it's a division which is actually present in google cloud services)
