NoCode solutions!

---

4 phases:

- Data processing: automated feature engineering is performed
- Hyperparameter tuning and architecture search: done through 2 main technologies: neural architecture search and transfer learning

Transfer learning: trained models are used to help and speed up training

Neural architecture search: multiple models are tried

- Bagging ensemble (usually around 10)
- Prediction
