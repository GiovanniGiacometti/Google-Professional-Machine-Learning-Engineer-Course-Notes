Natural language API will be used

It's a rest API, hence requests can be made with a post request and a json body

Python and other languages libraries are available

```json
{
  "document":{
    "type":"PLAIN_TEXT",
    "content":"Joanne Rowling, who writes under the pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist and screenwriter who wrote the Harry Potter fantasy series."
  },
  "encodingType":"UTF8"
}
```

This is a request.
The content can also be a pointer to a file saved in the Cloud Storage
