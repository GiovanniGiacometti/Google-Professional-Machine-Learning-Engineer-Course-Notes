How to enhance the quality of response beyond prompt design?

Different options, less or more technical

- Prompt design
- Fine tuning: high computation and high cost
- Parameter efficient tuning: adding additional layers, train a subset of parameters. For instance, Adapter tuning, RL or Distilling (transfer knowledge from bigger to smaller models, for instance by explaining the rationale behind some answers)
