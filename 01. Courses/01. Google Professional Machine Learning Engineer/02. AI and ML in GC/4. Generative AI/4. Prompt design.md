- Zero shot prompting 
- One shot prompting: a single example of the task
- Few shot prompting: give some examples

Freeform / Structured in Vertex UI

Best practices:

- Be coincise
- Be specific
- Ask one task at a time
- Include examples

Where to act to improve:

- different models
- temperature
- top k or top p

Top k: returns a random word from the set of top K possible words

Top p: returns a random word from the smallest subset with the sum of the likelihoods that exceeds or equals P
The size of the words can change
