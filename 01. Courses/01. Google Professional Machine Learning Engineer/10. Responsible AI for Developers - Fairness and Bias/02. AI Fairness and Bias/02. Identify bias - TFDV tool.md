Data:

Does the dataset have a proper distribution?

Is the proportion of true labels same or similar?

Even if a dataset contains a sufficient number of data points for the minority population, the label proportion can be different from the one of the majority population and you can check for bias issues in different ways.


Model:

Does the model perform fairly to different subsets of groups?

Does the outcome benefit/harm specific groups over others?

TF Data Validation is a good solution (compatible also with other frameworks)

Not developed for fairness only

- scalable calculation of summary statistics of training and test data, also for data slices

- data viewer - automatic tag of particular features (such as too many values = 0)

- automatic schema generation (useful for data schema generation)

- anomaly detection for missing features, out of range values...
