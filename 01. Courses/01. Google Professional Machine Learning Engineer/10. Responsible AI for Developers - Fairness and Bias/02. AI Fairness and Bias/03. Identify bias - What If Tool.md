Visualize inference results

Edit a datapoint and see how the model performs (especially useful for points close to the decision boundary).

Counterfactual analysis -> You can change a specific feature and see if the prediction is affected by that

Partial dependence plots to see the effect of single features

Arrange examples by similarity

Confusion matrices and other metrics - compute optimal classification threshold given costs

Test algorithmic fairness constraints - analyze model performance for sensitive features
Can also compute the optimal threshold given a fairness objective, such as demographic parity
