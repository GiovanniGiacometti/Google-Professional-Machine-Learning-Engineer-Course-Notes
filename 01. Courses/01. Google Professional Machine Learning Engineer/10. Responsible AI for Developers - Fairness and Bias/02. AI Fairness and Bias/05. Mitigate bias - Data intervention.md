Ensure all groups have sufficient representation

Ensure data do not skew towards harmful biases

No unintended biases in the way data was captured

---

Techniques: 

- Refine data collection pipeline if bias is identified 

Specifically, understand filters in the data collection and its implication

Monk Skin Tone scale can be used to evaluate models

- Balance data 

Up/down sample minority/majority groups examples

It's cheap
Might overfit to underrepresented groups


- Augment with other data (new datasets, synthetic data..)

Balance groups without downsampling majority subgroups

Limitations:
- technical complexity
- training on synthetic data can be problematic
- new data collection is time consuming and expensive

- Relabel data to update labels to current standards

Remove harmful labels

This might not change underlying biases.
