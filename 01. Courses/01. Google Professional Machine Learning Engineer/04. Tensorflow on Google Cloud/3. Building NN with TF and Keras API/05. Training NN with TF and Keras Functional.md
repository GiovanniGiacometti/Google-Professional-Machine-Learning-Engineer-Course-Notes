Wide and Deep Learning

Memorization + Generalization
But with exceptions

---

Linear models are good for sparse, independent features

DNNs are good for dense, highly correlated features

These can be easily built with Keras **Functional** API

It makes it easy to manipulate different inputs and multiple outputs

Also it comes handy for models that share layers.

keras.Model(inputs=..., outputs=....)

Strenghts:

- less verbose
- validates the model while building it (kind of static analysis)
- plottable and inspectable
- can be serialized or cloned

Weaknesses:

- no dynamic architectures (like tree rnn)
- requires subclassing for specific behaviours
