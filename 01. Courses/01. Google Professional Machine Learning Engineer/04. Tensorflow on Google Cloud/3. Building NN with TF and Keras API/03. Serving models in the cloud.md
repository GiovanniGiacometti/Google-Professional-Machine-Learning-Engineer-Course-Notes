We need to save and export our model into a file.

There are a lot of ways to save the model

---

`SaveModel` is the universal serialization format

---

One option is to use Vertex AI

1) Create a model object
2) Create a version of the model
3) Deploy SavedModel using gcloud-ai-platform (this takes many parameters, such as the python version, the backend used...)

---

Make predictions by using gcloud-ai-platform predict call, with the model, the version and an optional file where predictions should be stored.
