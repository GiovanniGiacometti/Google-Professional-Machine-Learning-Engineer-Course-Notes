Too complex of a model -> overfit and the model will perform badly on test data

---

How to understand if the model is too complex?

Apply Occam's razor as a heuristic: select the model that makes the fewest assumptions

---

Factor in model complexity when computing error

Minimize the loss + complexity of the model (multiplied by a coefficient that allows us to tune this component)
