### Ecosystem

Tensorflow is an high performance library for numerical computation (any kind, not only ML related)

---

It creates by creating a DAG, where nodes are the mathematical operations and the edges are the inputs and the outputs of the operation. At the bottom, there's the raw data

---

Scalar: rank 0, just a number
Vector: rank 1, an array
Matrix: rank 2

....

A tensor is an n-dim array

---

TensorFlow graphs are portable between different devices, it can be executed in any device.

The execution engine, written in C++, is very efficient and targets any device.

---

Common pattern: train a model on the cloud and then put it on an edge device (TF lite)

### API Hierarchy

Lowest layer: abstraction layer, which makes TF able to run on different hardwares

Core TensorFlow, C++, where everything is implemented

Core TensorFlow, Python

Components: tf.losses, tf.metrics, tf.optimizers..

High level API: tf.estimator, keras, tf.data

---

Vertex AI comprises all the layers


### TF Components


tf.constant produces constant tensors
tf.Variable produces tensors that can be modified

in Variable, we can define the type and also the name

GradientTaype records operation for automatic differentiation
