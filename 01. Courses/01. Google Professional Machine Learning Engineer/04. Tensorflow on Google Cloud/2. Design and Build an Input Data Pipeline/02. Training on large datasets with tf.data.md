tf.data -> tf.data.Dataset abstraction. It represents a sequence of elements, where each elements consists of 1 or more component.

For instance, in an image pipeline, an element might be a single training example, made up of the image tensor and the label tensor.

---

2 ways to construct a dataset:

- construct it from data stored in memory / files
- from tf.datasets objects

---

Large datasets are sharded in multiple files that are loaded when needed.

---

Many classes that extends Dataset, specific for different file formats.

---

Example: TFRecordDataset

They show a piece of code where they manipulate some data with this object.

1) shuffle
2) map with a udf function
3) batch function
4) iterate over it

The TFRecord format is a simple format for storing a sequence of binary records
