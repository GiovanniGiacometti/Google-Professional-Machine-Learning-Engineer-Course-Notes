Embedding column: represents data as a lower dimensional, dense vector

Movie recommendation

1 million customers (rows) 500000 movies (columns)

Values are the ratings given by customers to each movie.

Our approach is to organize movies by similarity

For instance:

- average age of viewers
- gross ticket sales
- ...

The input has n dimensions (500000 in our case) -> reduced to a d dimensional points (2 for instance). 
d is an hyperparameters to be set:
- higher dimensional can be more accurate, but the model is larger (training longer) and possible overfitting.
