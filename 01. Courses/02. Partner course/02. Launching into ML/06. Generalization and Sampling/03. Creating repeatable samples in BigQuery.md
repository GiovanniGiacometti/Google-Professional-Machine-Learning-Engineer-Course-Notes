Experimentation requires repeatability

Can't just do rand() < 0.8 or the order would not be obtainable again

Use the has and modulo operator (last digits of the hash of the field we want to bucketize on)

```
MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(date)), 10) < 8
```

What field to split the data on?

On a field we can afford to lose.

Of course it needs to have some values (if just 2 values, we could not split it in a granular way such as 80 20)

Pitfall

Chaining hashes to create subset won't work

First, mod with 70 == 0

This will get 1 every 70 rows

Then, mod with 700 and take those >= 350

This gets the half of the points

and then mod with 700 and < 525 -> around 25% of the data
