**Discovery phase**

Business use case definition
Contextual understanding of the users and people who may be affected by the solution
Feasibility Assessment

Data Exploration
Architecture and Algorithm selection


**Development phase**

Overlap with the previous phase during data exploration (sometimes a proof of concept is needed contextually to the feasibility assessment)

Data pipeline creation and feature engineering

Model building and evaluation (usually iterating)

Presentation of results

Might need to rivisit use case / chosen dataset / different algorithms or data transformation

**Deployment phase**

Plan for deployment (how many nodes are needed in the cluster, which platform..)

Model operationalization

Model monitoring

These help with maintenance and prevent model decau
