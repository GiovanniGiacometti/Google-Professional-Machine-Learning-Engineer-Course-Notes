Automate each step of the ML workflow

Backbone of MLOps on Google Cloud are [[Vertex AI Pipelines]] (support both [[Kubeflow]] Pipelines and [[TFX]])

---

2 different environments

Experimentation / development / test

Staging / pre-prod / production environment

The output of the first stage is a Trained Model, which can be moved to a Model Registry

Then, in the second environment, the model is deployed

Each process can be seen as a component of a pipeline

Either custom components or pre-built components

Google identifies 3 levels

Phase 0

Starting point

Phase 1
