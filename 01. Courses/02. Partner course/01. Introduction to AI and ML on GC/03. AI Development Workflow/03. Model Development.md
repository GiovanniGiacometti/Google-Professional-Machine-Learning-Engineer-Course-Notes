Recall: TP / TP + FN

Refers to ALL positive cases and looks at how many cases where predicted correctly 

Precision: TP / TP + FP

Refers to all cases predicted as positive and looks at how many were actually positive


They are a tradeoff

Precision Recall curve

Higher threshold: increases precision, but decreases recall

Lower threshold: decreases precision but increases recall
