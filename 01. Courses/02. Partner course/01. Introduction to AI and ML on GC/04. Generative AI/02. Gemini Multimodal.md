Multimodal: ingest and output content in multiple modalities

Diverse ranges of use cases

How to interact?

3 approaches:

- UI within Google Cloud console
- SDK in different languages
- API with cli tools

Always, start with a prompt

---

A prompt:

- input: the request (question, task, entity that the model can operate on, completions)
- context (optional): instructions or info to use when generating the response
- examples(optional): zero/one/few shot prompting

**Prompt design**: lot of experimentation
