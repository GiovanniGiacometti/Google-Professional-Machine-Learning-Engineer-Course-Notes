- Networking and security

- Compute and storage: decoupled, can scale independently

- Data and AI products


### Compute

Data needs grows, needs for compute grows

**Compute Engine**

- Infrastructure as a Service
- Compute, Storage and Network virtual resources as if it was a physical machine

Maximum flexibility for who wants to manage resources autonomously


**Google Kubernetes Engine**

- Containerized applications

**App Engine**

- fully managed Platform as a Service
- bind code to libraries (??)
- more focus on app logic

**Cloud Run**

- fully managed platform
- scales up and down from zero

**Cloud Run functions**

- serverless
- functions a service
- code execution in response to events

Many database services

The choice depends on:

- unstructured data
- structured data


Unstructured -> Google Cloud Storage is the most suited

It has 4 types of storage:

- standard storage: hot data, frequently accessed
- nearline storage: once per month on average (backups), once per month
- coldline storage: infrequently accessed, once every 90 days
- archive storage (once a year)

Structured. They are of 2 types

- transactional workload: 
- analytical workload

They can be accessed using sql or not.
