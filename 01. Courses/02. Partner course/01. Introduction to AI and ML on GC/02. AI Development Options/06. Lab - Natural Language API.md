[[Natural Language API]]

- Entity Analysis Request

For each entity in the response, you get the entity `type`, the associated Wikipedia URL if there is one, the `salience`, and the indices of where this entity appeared in the text. Salience is a number in the [0,1] range that refers to the centrality of the entity to the text as a whole.

The Natural Language API can also recognize the same entity mentioned in different ways. Take a look at the `mentions` list in the response: ​the API is able to tell that "Joanne Rowling", "Rowling", "novelist" and "Robert Galbriath" all point to the same thing.​

- Sentiment Analysis

Notice that you get two types of sentiment values: sentiment for the document as a whole, and sentiment broken down by sentence. The sentiment method returns two values:

- `score` - is a number from -1.0 to 1.0 indicating how positive or negative the statement is.
- `magnitude` - is a number ranging from 0 to infinity that represents the weight of sentiment expressed in the statement, regardless of being positive or negative.
