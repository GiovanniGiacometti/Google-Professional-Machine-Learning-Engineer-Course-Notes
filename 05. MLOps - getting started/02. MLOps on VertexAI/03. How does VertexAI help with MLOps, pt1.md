VertexAI automates ML processes but gives a lot of flexibility

Manage and govern:

- Feature Store can be used to create, store and share features
- Model registry, central repository where trained and deployed ML models can be tracked and organized
- ML Metadata -> automatically track inputs and outputs of all components, along with various metadata
- Model Evaluation -> iteratively run model evaluations on new datasets at scale

-> VertexAI pipelines

Composed of a set of input parameters and a list of steps. Can be used to experiment but also to define repeatable strategies.

They let ML engineers to focus on solutions rather than on the infrastructure necessary to run those solutions
