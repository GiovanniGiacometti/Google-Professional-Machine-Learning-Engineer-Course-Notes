Understand -> Vertex Explainable AI

Fully managed device that provides feature attributions, that shows how much each feature contributes to the model prediction and predicted power, 

Supported for all kinds of models and data types (even custom models)

Three methods are used:
- Sampled shapley
- integrated gradients
- ranked area integrals (XRAI)

All based on Shapley Values

Monitoring -> Vertex AI Model Monitoring

Monitor model predictions and feature distribution (skew detection)

Drift detection also can be enabled if historical data are not available

---

Track -> compare multiple models and identify the best one

VertexAI pipelines

VertexAI tensorboard - provides tools to visualize metrics and model weights and bias

Vertex AI Tabular Workflow -> pipelines for tabular data using AutoML
