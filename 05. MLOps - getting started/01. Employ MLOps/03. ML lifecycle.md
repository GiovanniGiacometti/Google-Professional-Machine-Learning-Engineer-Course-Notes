3 main phases:

- Discovery phase
- Development
- Deployment

Nonetheless, constant iteration, tuning and improvements are always performed, like:

- revisit chosen dataset (maybe the model needs more data, or different features)
- revisit use case

---

Discovery: problem is defined and desired outcome identified

It includes the business use case definition, the identification of the users, use case feasibility.
- Data exploration
- Architecture and algorithm selection

---

Development phase

Sometimes it starts in data exploration (to develop proofs of concepts)

Data pipeline creation and feature engineering is performed here.
Once data is ready, model is built and evaluate

---

Deployment phase

Plan for deployment: which platform, how many nodes in the cluster?

Model monitoring should be performed
