The level of automation defines the maturity of the process:

- level 0 -> build and deploy manually
- level 1 -> automate training
- level 2 -> automate training, validation and deployment


---

Level 0: entirely manually, no CI, lack of monitoring

---

Level 1: automate ML pipeline (not the full one)
Continuous training, continuous delivery

---

Level 2: ci/cd/ct lets easy explore new ideas (in terms of features and models)
