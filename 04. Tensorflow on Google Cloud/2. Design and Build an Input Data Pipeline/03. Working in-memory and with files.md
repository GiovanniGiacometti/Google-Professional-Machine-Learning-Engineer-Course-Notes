Create a dataset from tensors in memory:

- from_tensors: one unique element
- from_tensor_slices: separate element for each row

---

TextLineDataset can be used to read a file

How to load from multiple sharded files: 

tf.data.Dataset.list_files(path).flat_map(tf.data.TextLineDataset)

list_files: returns a tf.data.dataset where each element is a file path (as a string)

According to claude:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.list_files("/data/*.txt")

for file_path in dataset:
    print(file_path.numpy().decode())

# This might print:
# /data/file1.txt
# /data/file2.txt
# /data/file3.txt
```

flat_map: applies the function (in this case, tf.data.TextLineDataset to each path) and then flattens the result in a single dataset

If I do map instead of flat map:

This is how it looks, they actually didn't get flattened.

Dataset allows data to be prefetched.

This and multithreaded loading performance can really get better, as both CPU and GPU are always busy.
