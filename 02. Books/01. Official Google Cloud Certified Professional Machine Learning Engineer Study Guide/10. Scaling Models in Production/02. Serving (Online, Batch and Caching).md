Static features

- their values are updated in a batch, don't change in real time
- usually in a data warehouse (customer ID, movie ID)
- usually stored in NoSQL db ([[Firestore]]), optimized for singleton lookup operations

Dynamic features

- computed on the fly, in an event stream processing pipeline
- usually, for them you need a list of aggregated values for a particular window
- Can implement a dataflow streaming pipeline for dynamic feature read and store them in a low latency read/write database (Cloud Bigtable)

### Pre-computing and caching predictions

Another option is to pre-compute predictions in an offline batch scoring job and store them in a low latency read store data like [[Memorystore]] or [[Datastore]] (optimized for singleton reads)

Here the approach is hybrid: top N entities have predictions precomputed, the others are obtained from the model
