At which point do you retrain the model?

[[Vertex AI Model Monitoring]] offers you the ability to monitor for drift detection and training-serving skew

### Triggers for retraining

- absolute threshold (when accuracy falls below a certain threshold)
- rate of degradation

- Retraining on a fixed schedule

### Versioning model

Deploy additional model with a different version ID, so that users can change
