The level of automation of the various steps of the ML workflow defines the maturity of MLOps

### MLOps Level 0 - Manual / Tactical Phase

Organizations that start to experiment with ML

POCs and test ML use cases

- Manual
- Division between ML and MLOps
- Deployment of only the prediction service, not the whole ML system

Main challenge: model degradation


### MLOps Level 1 - Strategic Automation Phase


Use of pipelines to automate continuous training and continuous delivery of the model prediction service

- Automation in the experimentation phase
- Continuous training

Challenge: manual deployment of pipelines (usually a few of them)


### MLOps Level 2 - CI/CD Automation

The entire pipeline, not just the model, goes through CI/CD

Pipeline: everything is automated

Testing: feature engineering logic, model training convergence, everything is tested

Delivery
