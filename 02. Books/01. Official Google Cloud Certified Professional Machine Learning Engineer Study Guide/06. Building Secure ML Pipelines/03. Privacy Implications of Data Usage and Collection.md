PII (Personally Identifiable Information) -> data that allows an individual to be identified

PHI (Protected Health Information)

### Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention

The Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API can de-identify sensitive data in text

It detects sensitive information and uses a de-identification transformation to mask 

Some key concepts:

- Data Profiles -> protect data across organization. It scans all bq tables
- Risk Analysis -> before de-identification to help determine an effective strategy
- Inspection (jobs and triggers) -> inspection jobs can be triggered on specific events, such as every time a file is uploaded (with Cloud Functions)

### Google Cloud Healthcare API for PHI Identification

This API has the de-identify operation, to remove PHI

PCA can also be used

Another technique is Coarsening -> decrease granularity of data
