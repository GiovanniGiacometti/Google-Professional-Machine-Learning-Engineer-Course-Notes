GC provides built-in security measures to facilitate data security

### Encryption at rest

Data stored at rest by default in BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage

GC manages the encryption keys used to protect your data

Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) for Big Query

-> Server Side Encryption: after the storage receives data, before it's written to disk and stored (keys can be managed using GC Key Management Service)
-> Client-Side Encryption: before data is sent (undergoes also server-side encryption) - you are responsible

### Encryption in transit

TLS is used

### Encryption in Use

Protects data in memory from compromise while it's being processed.

An example is Confidential Computing
