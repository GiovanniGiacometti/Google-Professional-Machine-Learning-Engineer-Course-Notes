Vertex AI uses IAM to manage access to resources

Principal: user, group or service account (account for an application or compute workload)

Can be both:

-> project level

-> resource level: for specific resources, set a IAM policy on the resource

IAM roles that can be used within Vertex AI:

- predefined roles (administrator, user), project level
- basic roles (owner, editor, viewer), project level
- custom roles, specific set of permissions

### IAM Permissions for Vertex AI Workbench

Vertex AI Workbench is a data science offered by GCP that leverages JupyterLab to epxlore and access data

Google provides encryption at rest and in transit

2 types of notebooks

- user-managed: highly customizable
- managed notebooks: less customizable, automatically integrated with Cloud Storage and BigQuery

2 ways to set up user access modes:

- single user only: access granted only to the specified user
- service account: access to a service account

### Securing Vertex AI Workbench

- private IP address
- connect the instance to a VPC in the same project -> need to configure private services access (useful if you want to use internal addresses)
- shared VPC network
- VPC Service Control -> to control the service available in the VPC

### Securing Vertex AI Endpoints

-> public: accessible on the internet
-> private: a private connection to talk to the endpoint without data ever traversing public internet (through VPC peering, which is basically a way to connect two VPC so that resources in each network can communicate)


### Securing Vertex AI Training Jobs

Use private IP addresses to connect to your training jobs - again, VPC peering

Not so clear to me which vpc we should connect

Asked to Claude:

How it works:

1. You set up VPC peering between ShopSmart's VPC and the Vertex AI network.
2. You create a custom training job on Vertex AI.
3. In your training code, you can now directly query the private database using its internal IP address.
4. Vertex AI runs your training job, accessing the data securely over the peered connection.
5. Once training is complete, you can deploy your model on Vertex AI or export it back to your own infrastructure.


### Federated Learning

### Differential Privacy

Public sharing information about a dataset, by describing patterns, while withholding information about each individual in the dataset

### Format-Preserving Encryption and Tokenization

Encryption algorithm that preserves the format of information while it is being encrypted
