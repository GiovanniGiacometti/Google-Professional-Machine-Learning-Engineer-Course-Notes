Several data stores are available

### Google Cloud Storage

Service to store objects -> image, video, audio, unstructured data

### BigQuery

Best for tabular data.
For training data, best to store data as tables rather than views, for speed

### Vertex AI Managed Datasets

Use Vertex AI managed datasets to train custom models instead of writing your training application to ingest data from storage.

### Vertex AI Feature Store

Managed centralized repository for organizing, storing and serving ML features

### NoSQL

Optimized for singleton lookup operation, such as feature lookup during prediction

Options:

- Memorystore (redis compatible)
- Datastore
- Bigtable 


You should avoid storing data in block storage such as a Network File System (NFS) or a virtual machine (VM) hard disk as itâ€™s harder to manage them and tune performance than in Google Cloud Storage or BigQuery. Also avoid reading data directly from databases such as Cloud SQL; instead, store data in BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, or a NoSQL data store for performance.
