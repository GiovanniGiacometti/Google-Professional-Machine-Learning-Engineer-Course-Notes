### Scaling behaviour

Vertex AI automatically scales to use more prediction nodes when the CPU usage of your existing nodes gets high

If using GPU, configure the trigger appropriately

### Finding the ideal MachineType

You need to include the model type, serving wrapper code in case of custom models, effective utilization of resources (CPU, memory, GPU), latency and throughput requirements, and price to determine the instance type to use.
