#### tf.data


Good practices:
- prefetch -> overlap preprocessing and model execution of a training step to decouple the time when data is produced and consumed
- interleave -> parallelize data reading
- cache -> cache data in memory during the first epoch
- vectorize operations (map transformation)

Tensorflow transform is a library part of [[TFX]] and allows to perform transformation

Emit a tf graph that reproduces transformations (avoiding training serving skew)

Transform pipelines using Cloud [[Dataflow]]

Again, what does this mean? In a notebook (https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/get_started), they convert the preprocessing function into a Beam pipeline (which can then be run on dataflow)
Practically speaking, they define a function that uses tensorflow transform and then pass this function into a beam pipeline (specifically in the beam function called `AnalyzeAndTransformDataset`)

It returns the transformed data and the transform function, which can then be used also in the inference phase to apply the same transformation
