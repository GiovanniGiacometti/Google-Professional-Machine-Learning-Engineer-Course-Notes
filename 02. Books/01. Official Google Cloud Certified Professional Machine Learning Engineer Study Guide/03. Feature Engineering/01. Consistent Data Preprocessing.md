FE: transforming raw data coming from various sources to features useful for model training

Why?

-> data compatibility (model needs input in a representation understood by the model)
-> data quality, helps the model have a better performance


---

Data transformation can be applied while generating data or within the model

The second one allows for decoupling data and transformation (if transf change, the data can be still used) and also makes it easy to use the same transformation during training and serving (no leakage)
