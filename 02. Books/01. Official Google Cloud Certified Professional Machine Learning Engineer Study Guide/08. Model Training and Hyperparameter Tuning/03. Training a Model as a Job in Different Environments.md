2 types of training

- AutoML
- Custom Training

Custom training lets you create a training application optimized for the targeted outcome.

### Training Workflow with Vertex AI

Options

- Training Pipelines

Both for AutoML and custom trained


- Custom jobs

Specify ow Vertex AI runs your custom training code (worker pools, machine types, settings). Only for custom training

- Hyperparameter tuning jobs

Search the best combination of hyperparameter by otpimizing metric values

Only for custom trained models

### Training Dataset Options

2 choices for storing and managing datasets

- no managed dataset
Stored in Big Query or GCS

- [[Managed datasets]] (preferred)


### Pre-built containers

Training with pre-built containers (many frameworks are supported)

A specific application code structure must be followed

Then, the code has to be exported to a bucket as a source distribution

Then, choose the compute instances

This command builds a docker image based on a prebuilt container and the local python code, pushes the image to the container registry and creates a custom job

```
gcloud ai custom-jobs create \   
--region=LOCATION \   
--display-name=JOB_NAME \   
--worker-pool-spec=machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE,replica-count=REPLICA_ COUNT,executor-image-uri=EXECUTOR_IMAGE_URI,local-package-path=WORKING_ DIRECTORY,script=SCRIPT_PATH
```

EXECUTOR_IMAGE_URI is the uri of the container image that runs the provided code

### Custom Containers

Faster start-up time, use ml frameworks of choice, extended support for distributed training

### Distributed training

Need to specify multiple machines in a training cluster.
The training service allocates the resources

The running job on a given node is called a replica.

A group of replicas with the same configuration is called a worker pool

These are the tasks of worker pools

Vertex AI makes Reduction Server available in a Docker container image that you can use for one of your worker pools during distributed training
