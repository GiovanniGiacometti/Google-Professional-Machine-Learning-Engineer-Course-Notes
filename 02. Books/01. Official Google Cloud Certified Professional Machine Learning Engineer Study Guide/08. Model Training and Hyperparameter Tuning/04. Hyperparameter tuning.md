Vertex AI applies Bayesian Optimization by default

It also supports grid search, random search and bayesian search

### Speed up hyperparams optimization


- Simple validation instead of cross validation if dataset is too large
- Parallelize the problem across multiple machine
- Avoid redundant computations

### How Vertex AI Hyperparameter Tuning Works

Requires communication between vertex ai and training application

When configuring a tuning job, you define the goal, the metric to optimize

A yaml file is used as config

### Vertex AI Vizier

It helps tuning hyperparameters in complex ml models

- no know objective function
- it also tunes parameters

#### How Vertex AI Vizier Differs from Custom Training

Both for ML and non ML use cases
