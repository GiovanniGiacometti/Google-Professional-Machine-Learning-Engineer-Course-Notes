### Collect

Batch or streaming data from various sources:

- **pub/sub** and pub/sub lite for real-time streaming. Serverless scalable service for messaging and real time analytics. Deep integration with processing services, such as Dataflow, and analytics service, such as BigQuery. For instance, you can stream data from a third party to BigQuery using PubSub

- **Datastream** for moving on premise Oracle and MySQL databases to GC data storage - synchronize data across different databases

- **Big Query Data Transfer Service**: load data from some sources to big query using this service (data warehouses, external cloud providers, google software as a service)


### Process

Process or transform data before training. Some tools

#### Cloud Dataflow

Serverless, fully managed data processing.

It uses Apache Beam.
It offers exactly-once streaming semantics, which means it has mechanism in place to process each message exactly one time (no handling duplicates or errors)

#### Data Fusion

UI-based ETL tool

#### Dataproc

Fully managed and scalable service for running Spark, Flink, Presto.

It lets you take advantage of these open-source data tools while its automation helps create clusters quickly and manage them easily.

Uses Hadoop Distributed File System for storage

It has connectors with Cloud Storage (data can be processed directly there, without being transferred)

With BigQuery

BigQuery Spark connector

BigTable

Pub Sub Lie Spark

#### Cloud Composer

Fully managed data workflow orchestration service.

Built on Apache Airflow, pipelines are configured as DAGs using python

End to end integration with GC services.


#### Cloud Dataprep

UI-based ETL tool to visually explore, clean and prepare structured and unstructured data for analysis

### Store and Analyze

![[Pasted image 20241009192050.png]]

In Cloud Storage, files should be at least of 100 MB and between 100 and 10000 shards.
For TF workloads, store data as sharded TFRecord files, for other framework, use avro
