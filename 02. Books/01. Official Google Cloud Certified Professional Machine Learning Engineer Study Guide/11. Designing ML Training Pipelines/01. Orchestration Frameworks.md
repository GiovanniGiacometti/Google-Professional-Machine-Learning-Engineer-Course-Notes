The orchestrator runs the pipeline ina sequence and moves to the next step based on defined conditions

### [[Kubeflow]] pipelines

It's the ML toolkit for Kubernetes.

Any ML framework can be run

Based on Docker containers

A pipeline is a description of an ML workflow in the form of a graph, including all components in the workflow and how they relate to each other

Each component is a container. When the pipeline iss run, each container goes in a Pod

Kubeflow Pipelines can be run in GKE or you can use managed [[Vertex AI Pipelines]] to run Kubeflow Pipelines

### Vertex AI Pipelines

Run Kubeflow or TFX pipelines without spinning servers.

It automatically provisions the underlying architecture and infra.

It also provides Lineage -> tracking the movement of data over time from source to its consumption.

Each pipeline run produces metadata and ML artifacts.

Artifact lineage describes all the factors that resulted in an artifact.

There are prebuilt components (such as AutoML)

Lineare is tracked using [[Vertex AI Metadata]], which stores artifacts and metadata for pipelines run using Vertex AI Pipelines

### Apache Airflow

A platform that lets you build and run workflows.

It's a DAG, containing tasks

### [[Cloud Composer]]

Fully managed workflow orchestration service built on Airflow.

It is best for batch workloads that can handle a few seconds of latency between tasks executions.
