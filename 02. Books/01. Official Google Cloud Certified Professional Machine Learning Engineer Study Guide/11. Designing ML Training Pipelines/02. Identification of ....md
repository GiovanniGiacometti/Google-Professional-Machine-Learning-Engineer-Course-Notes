The idea is to automate the ML production pipelines.

For instance, when new data is available, train a new model.

Kubeflow Pipelines provides a Python SDK to operate the pipeline programmatically using the Client

- using Cloud Scheduler
- responding to event, using Pub Sub and Cloud Functions (for instance, when new data is available in GCS)
- Using Cloud Composer (as part of a bigger data process)
- Argo, a scheduler for recurring pipelines
- Jenkins

### Schedule Vertex AI Pipelines

- [[Cloud Scheduler]] + Cloud Function on HTTP Trigger (not clear why Cloud Function is needed here, isn't the scheduler able to do the work itself?)
- Cloud [[Pub Sub]] + [[Cloud Function]]
