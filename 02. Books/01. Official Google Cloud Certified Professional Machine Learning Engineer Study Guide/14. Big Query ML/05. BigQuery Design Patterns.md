### Hashed Features

Transform high cardinal variables in a low cardinal domain by hashing

ABS(MOD(FARM_FINGERPRINT(zipcode), numbuckets))

### Transforms

The transformations applied to the inputs to the training dataset must also be applied to the inputs if the model is deployed in production. So the code to transform is part of the pipeline when you are making the predictions.

BigQuery has an elegant solution, called TRANSFORM, that is part of the CREATE_MODEL function

this doesn't work outside of Big Query
