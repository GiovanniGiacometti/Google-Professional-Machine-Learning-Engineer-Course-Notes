Training-serving skew should be monitored

Prediction skew -> if there is no access to original data, it can be used to monitor inputs

---

Categorical features: compute L-infinity distance between baseline and latest production distribution

Numerical features: Jensen Shannon divergence


Input schemas: they are part of the payload of the prediction requests
