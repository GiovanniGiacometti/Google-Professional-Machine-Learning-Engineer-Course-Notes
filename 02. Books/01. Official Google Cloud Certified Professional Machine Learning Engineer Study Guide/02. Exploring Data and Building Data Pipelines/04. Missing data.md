Result of failures to record data / data corruption

Many strategies:

- delete rows or columns
- Replace with mean, median, mode (works well with small datasets). Notice it doesn't factor in the covariance between features and can cause data leakage
- Impute (for categorical variables) with the most frequent category
- Use the last valid observation to fill in the missing value (last observation carried forward method)
- Interpolate (time series)
- Use ML to predict missing values

Some algorithms (such as KNN) are able to ignore columns
