Reliability: the degree to which you can trust your data.  It is not reliable if it has missing values, duplicate values...

### Data skew

Having extreme outliers can affect the model's capability -> with transformations, we can transform skewed distribution to normal distribution by removing outliers

If the target is skewed -> Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), undersampling, or oversampling

### Normalization

Transform features to be on a similar scale -> helps improve performance and training stability of the model

- Scaling -> between 0 and 1 
- Log Scaling -> when some of the data samples are in very different ranges
- Z-score: scale with meaning and std dev
- Clipping: in the case of extreme outliers


Handling outliers -> need some viz techniques to detect them
Once detected it should either be removed from the dataset, so that it doesn't affect model training, or impute or replace to either mean, median, mode or boundary values
