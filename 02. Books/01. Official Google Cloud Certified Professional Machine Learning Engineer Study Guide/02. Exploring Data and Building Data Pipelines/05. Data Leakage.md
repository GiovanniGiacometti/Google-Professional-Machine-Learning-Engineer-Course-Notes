Expose ML model to the test data during training

Possible reasons:

- Target is added to features
- Wrong data split
- Features that expose the information about the target variable not available at inference time (label leakage)
- Preprocessing techniques applied to the whole dataset
- In time series data, using data from the future when doing computations for current features

Correlation between features and target is helpful in detecting data leakage. If the correlation is too high, there might be a leakage.

Example: the hospital name being used to understand whether a person has cancer

-> Certain hospitals specialize in treating cancer. During training, the model quickly learned that patients assigned to certain hospitals very likely had cancer. So, hospital name became a highly weighted feature.
