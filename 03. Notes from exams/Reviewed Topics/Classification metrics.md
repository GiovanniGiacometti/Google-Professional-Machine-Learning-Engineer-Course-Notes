Precision -> focus on positive class. Maximize if the goal is to minimize false positives (raise the threshold)

Recall -> also known as true positive rate. Maximize if we want to minimize false negatives (lower the threshold)

Precision Recall curveÂ indicates how well a model predicts the positive class
Should be used when the dataset is imbalanced.
